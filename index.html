            <p>I am a Responsive Web Developer who thrives on visual storytelling. When I am not working, 
            pursuing side projects or getting lost in the rabbit hole of blogs & books, I can be found
            across the United States at our son's travel baseball tournaments. </p>

                <p>I was born in Southern California and grew up there until I was 14 when we moved to Colorado. 
                    After graduating from Cal Poly, SLO I moved up to the Seattle area and spent 20+ years there
                    until finally moving back to Colorado to stay for good.

                <p>We spend a lot of time now traveling to watch our son play competitive baseball. We love hanging
                    out in the sun and watching his games with his brother. Between that and work we are always on the go.

                <p>My oldest will be in high school next year and we are hoping for him that he will be able to play as 
                    many sports as he would like for as long as possible. He is considering football, basketball and of 
                    course baseball! He is definitely excited about graduating out of middle school.
